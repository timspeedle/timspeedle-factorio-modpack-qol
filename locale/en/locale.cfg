[mod-description]
description=This mod is a curated list of quality-of-life improving mods. I use this as a convenience for me to include all my favorites in one place, rather than having to add all of them into my game.\n\nThis modpack introduces a couple of changes to the default configuration of the included mods. See the GitHub repo's README.md for detailed information.
